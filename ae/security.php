          <p class="fs18">Your data is on AWS cloud, a Linux server and Giddh uses java as backend development. This makes your data much more secure compared to any other local server. Giddh processes your data in an encrypted format, which can’t be accessed even by our developers. Your data could be at high risk if you are on local server. It can be leaked and an onsite disaster will get your data destroyed along with the backups.</p>
